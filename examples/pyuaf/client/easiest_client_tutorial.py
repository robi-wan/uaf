# Define the ClientSettings:
myClientSettings = ClientSettings()
myClientSettings.applicationName = "MyClient"
myClientSettings.discoveryIntervalSec = 20.0 # try to re-discover the servers in the network every 20 seconds
# ... many more settings
myClientSettings.discoveryUrls.append("opc.tcp://localhost:48010")
# ... append as many Discovery URLs as you want. 
#
# FYI: what are Discovery URLs?
#  -> A Discovery URL is the URL of a so-called "Discovery Endpoint".
#  -> Clients can use this Discovery Endpoint to learn ("discover") how they can connect to the server, by
#     learning the other endpoints of the server. For example, a server may expose (besides a Discovery Endpoint)
#     an unsecured endpoint and a secured one. The client can then choose to connect to the server via one
#     of these endpoints, and start reading/writing/monitoring/... data.
#  -> Discovery URLs are often of the form opc.tcp://<someIpAddressOrHostname>:4840 or :4841
#  -> The UAF makes it easy for you to deal with discovery: just specify the discovery URLs of the servers you may
#     want to use later on, and specify your favorite way of connecting to a server (e.g. without security). The UAF
#     will take care of the Discovery process and the connection process for you. A background thread will check 
#     every 20 seconds (configurable, see above) the URLs you provided, and keep an inventory of all discovered 
#     endpoints. If at some point the UAF thinks it's necessary to connect to one of these servers (e.g. because
#     you want to read a variable on a particular server), it will automatically create the necessary session
#     for you. 
#  -> Bottomline: just provide the discovery URLs to the UAF, and afterwards you can directly start
#     reading data or monitoring events or calling methods or whatever. No need to manage connections yourself! 
#  -> All OPC UA servers have such a Discovery endpoint, but additionally there are also "dedicated" discovery servers
#     that do nothing more than provide endpoints to other servers. Most people will never have to deal with such a 
#     server, however. 
#  -> In the (advanced!) scenario where a hierarchy of dedicated discovery servers is used, you only need to specify
#     the top discovery server. The UAF will automatically discover the discovery servers that are lower in the 
#     hierarchy.

# 4) relative address to the "Boiler1" node (relative to the previous address)
# 5) relative address to the "TemperatureSetpoint" Double variable (relative to the previous relative (!!!) address)
# 6) relative address to the "HeaterStatus" node (relative to the standard "Root" folder)

address_Boiler1      = Address( address_BoilerDemo , [ RelativePathElement(QualifiedName("Boiler1"            , demoNsUri)) ] )
address_TSetpoint    = Address( address_Boiler1    , [ RelativePathElement(QualifiedName("TemperatureSetPoint", demoNsUri)) ] )
address_HeaterStatus = Address( address_Root       , [ RelativePathElement(QualifiedName("Objects"            , 0        )),
                                                       RelativePathElement(QualifiedName("Demo"               , demoNsUri)),
                                                       RelativePathElement(QualifiedName("BoilerDemo"         , demoNsUri)),

# In the above examples, 0 is used to identify the "standard OPC UA namespace" (which is ALWAYS 0).
# We could also have replaced 0 with the standard OPC UA namespace URI ('http://opcfoundation.org/UA/').
# This namespace URI is available as a constant: pyuaf.util.constants.OPCUA_NAMESPACE_URI.

# As you can see above, there are a variety of ways how you can address a node. 
# But there are even more things you can do:
#  - for each ExpandedNodeId, NodeId or QualifiedName, you may include namespace indexes, or namespace URIs, or both
#  - relative addresses (relative "paths") may span over multiple servers!
# The UAF is capable of resolving these addresses fully automatically. You don't have to create sessions
# or subscriptions to servers in advance, the UAF can take care of that automatically as well. 

# Obviously for most applications, you don't have to make things as complicated as above.
# You probably want to specify just one absolute address (to a well-known node on a well-known server), 
# and then specify the addresses to the nodes you want to read/write/whatever via relative paths. 
# But the above examples demonstrate that with just one or two lines of code, you can address 
# any node within any address space very easily, in a variety of ways.

# We now define a few more addresses that we will need later on:

# Instead of the "convenience" function read(), we could have also used the "generic" function processRequest():
request = ReadRequest(2)
request.targets[0].address = address_TSetpoint
request.targets[1].address = address_HeaterStatus

result = myClient.processRequest(request)

# Internally, myClient.read() does exactly the same, only the API is different! 
# (So myClient.read(...) also creates a similar ReadRequest behind the scenes, and it also uses 
# the processRequest(<ReadRequest>) method afterwards). 
#
# So in both cases, a request (a "ReadRequest" in this case) is created either implicitly or explicitly.
# This request is then processed by the UAF client, and finally leads to a result (a "ReadResult" in this case). 
# 
# The structure of this request is like this:
# 
#  request                                          <ReadRequest>
#    |
#    |__targets                                     <ReadRequestTargetVector> (a sort-of "list" of targets)
#    |     |
#    |     |__[0]                                   <ReadRequestTarget>
#    |     |   |__address     = address_TSetpoint   <Address>
#    |     |   |__attributeId = attributeids.Value  <int>  
#    |     |   |__ ... more target details
#    |     |
#    |     |__[1]

#    |     |   |__attributeId = attributeids.Value   <int>   
#    |     |   |__ ... more target details
#    |     |
#    |     |__ ... more targets, if needed
#    |
#    |__serviceSettingsGiven                         <bool>                   (True if the given settings should be used)
#    |__serviceSettings                              <ReadSettings?           (configures the service call)

#    |     |__ ... more settings

# All requests have the same structure, so they contain:
#  - a vector of "request targets" (of type ReadRequestTarget, WriteRequestTarget, BrowseRequestTarget, ...)
#  - a "serviceSettings" instance and "serviceSettingsGiven" boolean to configure the service call 
#    ("serviceSettings" is of type ReadConfig, WriteConfig, BrowseConfig, ...)
#  - a "sessionSettings" instance and "sessionSettingsGiven" boolean to specify how the UAF should 
#    create or reuse sessions
#  - a "clientConnectionId" integer and "clientConnectionIdGiven" boolean, in case you want the 
#    request to be executed by a specific session 
#  - (for certain types of request, also an optional "subscriptionSettings", 
#    "subscriptionSettingsGiven", "clientSubscriptionHandle" and "clientSubscriptionHandleGiven" 
#    to specify how the UAF should create or reuse Subscriptions)




# An OPC UA service request will lead to a result.
# E.g. a WriteRequest (having one or more WriteRequestTargets) will lead to a WriteResult (with one or more 
# corresponding WriteResultTargets). 
# So in the case of the above ReadRequest, we could receive a result that looks like this:
# 
#  result                                           <ReadResult>
#    |
#    |__targets                                     <ReadResultTargetVector> (a sort-of "list" of targets)
#    |     |__[0]                                   <ReadResultTarget>
#    |     |   |__status          = Status(Good)    <Status>
#    |     |   |__data            = Double(20.0)    <Double>                 (could be any type of data, depends on the target)
#    |     |   |__sourceTimestamp = DateTime(...)   <DateTime>
#    |     |   |__ ... more target details
#    |     |
#    |     |__[1]                                   <ReadResultTarget>
#    |     |   |__status          = Status(Good)    <Status>
#    |     |   |__data            = Int32(2)        <Int32>                 (could be any type of data, depends on the target)
#    |     |   |__sourceTimestamp = DateTime(...)   <DateTime>
#    |     |   |__ ... more target details
#    |     |
#    |     |__ ... more targets (one "result target" for each "request target')
#    |
#    |__overallStatus = Status(Good)                <Status>                 (a sort-of summary of the target statuses)
#    |__requestHandle = 1                           <long>                   (an integer linking the result with a request) 
#

# ALL results have the same structure, so they contain:
#  - a list of "result targets", corresponding one-to-one with the "request targets" of the request
#  - an overall status, which is only "Good" if all statuses of all targets are "Good"
#  - a request handle, which is a 64-bit numerical identifier that is incremented for each request that is processed

# So we could do:
print("Result overall status: %s" %result.overallStatus)
print("Number of ReadResultTargets: %d" %len(result.targets))
for target in result.targets:
    if target.status.isGood():
        print(" - result target is good: data is %s (of type %s)" %(target.data, type(target.data)))
    else:
        print(" - result target is NOT good! (reason=%s)" %target.status)
